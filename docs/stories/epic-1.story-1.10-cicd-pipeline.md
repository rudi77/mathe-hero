# Story 1.10: CI/CD Pipeline & Coverage Reporting

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** automated testing and coverage reporting on every code change,
**so that** quality is enforced and visible to the team.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow configured to run tests on every push/PR.
2. Workflow fails if tests don't pass (blocking merge).
3. Coverage reports generated and displayed in PR comments or checks.
4. Coverage badge added to README showing current coverage percentage.
5. Pre-commit hooks configured to run tests locally before commits (optional but recommended).
6. Documentation updated with instructions for running tests locally (README or contributing guide).
7. Test watch mode works correctly during local development (`pnpm test` or `pnpm test:watch`).

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture

**CI Integration:**
- Run `pnpm test` on every push/PR via GitHub Actions
- Tests must pass before merge
- Coverage reports generated automatically

**Watch Mode:**
- Local development uses `pnpm test` in watch mode for instant feedback
- Vitest provides excellent watch mode with smart re-running

### GitHub Actions Workflow Template

**Basic Structure (.github/workflows/test.yml):**
```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: pnpm test

      - name: Generate coverage
        run: pnpm test:coverage

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: ./coverage/coverage-final.json
          fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### Coverage Reporting Options

**Option 1: Codecov (Recommended)**
- Free for open source
- Excellent PR integration
- Beautiful coverage visualization

**Option 2: Coveralls**
- Alternative to Codecov
- Similar features

**Option 3: GitHub Actions Summary**
- Built-in, no external service
- Less feature-rich but simple

### Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)

**Using Husky:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

**Hook configuration (.husky/pre-commit):**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

pnpm test
```

### Testing

- **Verify workflow:** Push to a test branch and verify GitHub Actions runs
- **Test coverage:** Ensure coverage reports are generated and uploaded
- **Test failure:** Create a failing test and verify workflow fails
- **Test badge:** Verify coverage badge displays on README

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

This is high-quality CI/CD infrastructure work that demonstrates strong understanding of modern DevOps practices. All 7 acceptance criteria are fully met with comprehensive implementation. The developer has gone beyond basic requirements by:

- Adding both Codecov integration AND GitHub Actions summary for coverage visibility
- Implementing multiple escape hatches for pre-commit hooks (--no-verify, HUSKY=0)
- Creating thorough documentation in both German and English contexts
- Properly handling the monorepo structure with working-directory parameters
- Using latest action versions (v4) and appropriate tool versions

The configuration files are clean, well-structured, and follow industry best practices.

### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

All acceptance criteria validated:

**AC1 - GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- **Given** code is pushed to main/develop, **When** push occurs, **Then** workflow triggers and runs tests
- ✓ Validated: `.github/workflows/test.yml` lines 4-7 configure triggers

**AC2 - Workflow Fails on Test Failure:**
- **Given** tests are failing, **When** workflow runs, **Then** build fails blocking merge
- ✓ Validated: Test step (line 36) will exit non-zero on failure, blocking workflow

**AC3 - Coverage Reports in PRs:**
- **Given** tests complete with coverage, **When** workflow finishes, **Then** coverage appears in PR comments/checks
- ✓ Validated: Codecov action (lines 48-53) + codecov.yml comment config + GitHub Actions summary (lines 55-73)

**AC4 - Coverage Badge:**
- **Given** README is viewed, **When** looking at header, **Then** coverage badge displays current percentage
- ✓ Validated: `src/README.md` lines 3-4 contain test status and codecov badges

**AC5 - Pre-commit Hooks:**
- **Given** developer commits, **When** commit created, **Then** tests run automatically with skip option
- ✓ Validated: `.husky/pre-commit` + `src/package.json` prepare script + documentation

**AC6 - Documentation:**
- **Given** developer needs to run tests, **When** reading README, **Then** clear instructions found
- ✓ Validated: Comprehensive testing section in README (lines 139-203) with all commands

**AC7 - Watch Mode:**
- **Given** developer runs `pnpm test`, **When** modifying files, **Then** tests auto-rerun
- ✓ Validated: `src/package.json` test script uses vitest without --run flag (default watch mode)

**Test Coverage Gap Analysis:** None - all ACs have clear validation paths.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The implementation is already clean and well-structured.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ PASS
  - TypeScript configuration files follow naming conventions
  - YAML files are properly formatted and readable
  - No JavaScript/TypeScript code to review for this infrastructure story

- **Project Structure:** ✓ PASS
  - Files placed in correct locations (.github/workflows/, .husky/, src/)
  - Follows monorepo structure with working-directory handling
  - Configuration files at appropriate levels

- **Testing Strategy:** ✓ PASS
  - Vitest configuration properly set up with coverage
  - Test commands are well-documented
  - Coverage targets (70%) align with project goals

- **All ACs Met:** ✓ PASS
  - All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Top Issues & Improvements

**CONCERNS (Minor - Not Blocking):**

1. **Pre-commit Hook Performance Impact**
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **What:** `.husky/pre-commit` runs full test suite on every commit
   - **Impact:** Could slow down commits significantly as test suite grows (currently ~160 tests)
   - **Suggested Owner:** dev
   - **Recommendation:** Consider running only linting/type-check in pre-commit, save full tests for CI
   - **Alternative:** Use `lint-staged` to run tests only on changed files

2. **Husky Prepare Script Platform Compatibility**
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **What:** `src/package.json` line 16: `"prepare": "cd .. && husky || true"`
   - **Impact:** The `|| true` masks failures; path navigation might behave differently on Windows
   - **Suggested Owner:** dev
   - **Recommendation:** Test on Windows and consider using Node-based path resolution or removing `|| true` for visible errors

3. **No CI/CD Workflow Validation Test**
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **What:** No automated way to validate workflow syntax/structure before pushing
   - **Impact:** Workflow errors only discovered after push to GitHub
   - **Suggested Owner:** dev
   - **Recommendation:** Consider adding `actionlint` or GitHub CLI workflow validation to pre-commit

**IMPROVEMENTS (Nice-to-have - Future Iterations):**

- [ ] Add workflow caching for pnpm dependencies to speed up CI (uses `pnpm/action-setup` cache)
- [ ] Consider adding `actionlint` for workflow validation
- [ ] Add CODECOV_TOKEN setup instructions to README (currently only in Dev Notes)
- [ ] Consider adding coverage trend visualization in README
- [ ] Extract coverage summary Node script to separate file for testability

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns identified

- Secrets properly referenced via GitHub repository secrets (`CODECOV_TOKEN`)
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in configuration files
- Codecov token usage follows best practices
- `.gitignore` properly excludes husky internal files (`.husky/_`)

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Performance is appropriate for CI/CD infrastructure

**Positive:**
- Workflow uses modern, efficient GitHub Actions (v4)
- Parallel execution potential (type-check, test, coverage run sequentially but could be optimized)
- Coverage artifacts uploaded for retention
- pnpm is fast package manager

**Minor Concern:**
- Pre-commit running full test suite could slow commits (see issue #1 above)
- No dependency caching configured (could add to speed up CI runs)

**Recommendation:** Add pnpm cache step:
```yaml
- name: Get pnpm store directory
  id: pnpm-cache
  run: echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ${{ steps.pnpm-cache.outputs.STORE_PATH }}
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
```

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Reliability:** ✓ PASS
- Workflow will reliably run on every push/PR
- Multiple redundancy in coverage reporting (artifact + Codecov + summary)
- Escape hatches prevent blocking legitimate commits

**Maintainability:** ✓ PASS
- Clear, readable YAML configuration
- Well-documented commands and workflows
- Standard tooling (Husky, Codecov) widely understood
- Excellent inline documentation

**Usability:** ✓ PASS
- Developer experience is excellent with comprehensive docs
- Multiple options for running tests (watch, UI, coverage, CI mode)
- Clear escape hatches documented

**Testability:** ✓ PASS
- Configuration files are declarative and easy to validate
- Workflow can be tested on feature branches before merge
- Pre-commit hooks testable locally

### Files Modified During Review

None - no refactoring or changes were necessary during this review.

### Quality Metrics

- **Requirements Coverage:** 7/7 ACs validated (100%)
- **Test Coverage:** N/A (infrastructure configuration, not application code)
- **Code Quality Score:** 70/100
  - Calculation: 100 - (20 × 0 FAIL issues) - (10 × 3 CONCERNS issues) = 70
- **Risk Level:** LOW (infrastructure configuration with minimal business logic)

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/epic-1.story-1.10-cicd-pipeline.yml

All acceptance criteria met. Minor concerns identified are non-blocking and can be addressed in future iterations. The CI/CD infrastructure is production-ready and follows industry best practices.

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done**

The implementation is complete, well-documented, and production-ready. The three CONCERNS identified are minor improvements that can be addressed in future iterations without blocking this story.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Merge this PR to enable CI/CD for the team
2. Set up CODECOV_TOKEN in GitHub repository secrets
3. Test workflow on first PR to validate end-to-end flow
4. Create follow-up story for performance optimizations (caching, lint-staged) if needed
