# Story 1.3: Math Engine - Answer Checking & Basic Feedback

## Status

**Done** ✅

## Story

**As a** User (Child),
**I want** to receive immediate feedback on whether my math answer is correct or incorrect,
**so that** I know if I solved the problem successfully.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After submitting an answer, the app checks if it's correct.
2. Clear visual feedback is provided for correct answers (e.g., green checkmark, positive sound).
3. Clear visual feedback is provided for incorrect answers (e.g., red cross, gentle sound).
4. The system correctly identifies right/wrong answers for the implemented problem types.
5. Unit tests verify the answer-checking logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement answer checking logic (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create answer validation function in mathEngine.ts
  - [x] Compare user answer with correct answer
  - [x] Handle edge cases (whitespace, negative numbers)
- [x] Implement visual feedback for correct answers (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add success state to MathTask component
  - [x] Display green checkmark/positive indicator
  - [x] Add positive sound effect
- [x] Implement visual feedback for incorrect answers (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add error state to MathTask component
  - [x] Display red cross/negative indicator
  - [x] Add gentle sound effect
- [x] Write unit tests (AC: 5)
  - [x] Test answer checking logic
  - [x] Test correct answer feedback
  - [x] Test incorrect answer feedback

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture

**Answer Checking:**
- Implemented in `mathEngine.ts` as part of problem validation
- Integrated with MathTask component state management
- Uses AppContext to track answer history

**Feedback System:**
- Visual feedback using CSS animations and state changes
- Sound effects for auditory feedback (optional)
- Child-friendly messaging and colors

### Testing

- Unit tests for answer validation logic
- Component tests for feedback rendering
- Edge case testing (boundary values, input variations)

## Dev Agent Record

### Completion Notes

**Note:** This is retroactive documentation of completed story.

**Implementation Summary:**
- Answer checking logic successfully implemented
- Visual feedback system working for both correct and incorrect answers
- Sound effects integrated for enhanced user experience
- Unit tests implemented and passing

### File List

**Modified:**
- `src/client/src/lib/mathEngine.ts` (added answer validation)
- `src/client/src/components/MathTask.tsx` (added feedback UI)
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/mathEngine.test.ts` (added answer checking tests)

## QA Results

**Status:** ✅ Passed (per Quinn's traceability report)

**Findings:**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Answer checking working correctly for all problem types
- Visual feedback clear and age-appropriate (green checkmark, red cross)
- Sound effects working and not overwhelming
- System correctly identifies right/wrong answers
- Unit tests passing with good coverage
