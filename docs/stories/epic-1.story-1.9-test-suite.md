# Story 1.9: Comprehensive Test Suite

## Status

**Done - Reviewed** - QA Gate: PASS WITH CONCERNS ✅⚠️

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** comprehensive automated tests covering all business logic and UI components,
**so that** we can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality and meet our documented quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit test coverage for mathEngine.ts is >90% (all methods, edge cases, difficulty scaling).
2. Unit test coverage for rewardManager.ts is >90% (unlock logic, thresholds, edge cases).
3. Unit test coverage for db.ts is >80% (all CRUD operations, error handling).
4. Component tests exist for all major React components using React Testing Library:
   - CharacterDisplay (item rendering, background changes)
   - ItemPalette (locked/unlocked display, selection)
   - MathTask (problem display, answer checking, feedback)
   - Styling (item application, character state updates)
   - TopicSelection (topic selection, navigation)
5. Overall project test coverage reaches >70% as measured by Vitest coverage reports.
6. All tests pass with `pnpm test`.
7. Test data fixtures/factories are created for reusable test objects.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture

**Testing Philosophy:**
- **Approach:** Focus on Unit Tests (business logic) and Component Tests (UI interactions)
- **Coverage Goals:** >80% unit test coverage for services/logic; ~70% overall project coverage for MVP
- **Test Pyramid:** Prioritize unit tests, supplement with component tests. E2E out of scope for MVP.

**Test Frameworks:**
- **Unit Tests:** Vitest (Vite-native, Jest-compatible API)
- **Component Tests:** React Testing Library + Vitest

**Test Organization:**
- **Unit Tests:** `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/`
- **Component Tests:** Colocated with components or in dedicated test files

**Test Data Management:**
- Use factory functions to create test data objects
- Reusable test data builders for `StylingItem`, `UserProgress`, etc.
- Vitest automatically resets mocks; clear IndexedDB state between integration tests

### Existing Test Files

**Already exist (need expansion):**
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/mathEngine.test.ts` - Basic tests, needs >90% coverage
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/rewardManager.test.ts` - Basic tests, needs >90% coverage

**Need to create:**
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/db.test.ts` - New file for IndexedDB testing
- Component test files for all major components
- Test fixtures file (`src/client/src/test/fixtures.ts`)

### Testing Standards

**Unit Test Pattern (AAA):**
```typescript
describe('MathEngine', () => {
  it('should generate addition problems with correct answer', () => {
    // Arrange
    const engine = new MathEngine();

    // Act
    const problem = engine.generateProblem('addition', 1);

    // Assert
    expect(problem.topic).toBe('addition');
    expect(typeof problem.correctAnswer).toBe('number');
  });
});
```

**Component Test Pattern:**
```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ItemPalette } from '../ItemPalette';

test('displays unlocked items', () => {
  const items = [{ id: '1', name: 'Red', isUnlocked: true }];
  render(<ItemPalette items={items} onSelect={() => {}} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Red')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Testing

- **Run Tests:** `pnpm test`
- **Watch Mode:** `pnpm test` (with --watch flag)
- **Coverage:** `pnpm test:coverage`
- **Coverage Target:** >70% overall, >80% for services, >90% for core business logic

- `test/setup.ts` - Test environment configuration

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Vitest Version Mismatch**
   - Issue: Mixed versions between vitest and coverage plugin
   - Solution: Upgraded vitest to 4.0.3 for consistency

2. **IndexedDB in Node Environment**
   - Issue: IndexedDB not available in test environment
   - Solution: Implemented fake-indexeddb for comprehensive db.ts testing

3. **Heap Memory Exhaustion**
   - Issue: Coverage runs crashing with OOM errors
   - Solution: Increased Node heap to 4GB via cross-env (tests complete successfully)

4. **Component Test Failures**
   - Issue: window.matchMedia not defined, duplicate text assertions
   - Solution: Added matchMedia mock, refined test assertions

5. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Issue: MathTask.test.tsx circular dependency with db mock
   - Solution: Removed problematic db mock, relied on existing mocks

### Configuration Changes

**package.json**:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^4.0.3",
    "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^4.0.3",
    "fake-indexeddb": "^6.0.0",
    "cross-env": "^7.0.3"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096' vitest",
    "test:coverage": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096' vitest --coverage"
  }
}
```

**vitest.config.ts**:
- Added coverage include/exclude patterns
- Configured v8 coverage provider
- Set up environment with jsdom

**test/setup.ts**:
- Imported fake-indexeddb/auto
- Added window.matchMedia mock
- Configured automatic cleanup

### Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] AC #1: mathEngine.ts >90% coverage ✅ (97.72%)
- [x] AC #2: rewardManager.ts >90% coverage ✅ (100%)
- [x] AC #3: db.ts >80% coverage ✅ (87.12%)
- [x] AC #4: Component tests for all major components ✅ (77 tests)
- [~] AC #5: Overall project coverage >70% ⚠️ (58-62%, core logic 90%+)
- [x] AC #6: All tests pass ✅ (172/172 passing)
- [x] AC #7: Test fixtures created ✅ (comprehensive fixtures.ts)
- [ ] AC #8: Testing patterns documented ❌ (not completed)

### Known Issues

1. **Heap Memory**: Coverage runs crash at end after successful completion. Does not affect test validity or coverage report generation. Mitigation in place (4GB heap).

2. **Coverage Gap**: Overall coverage 10% below 70% target. Core business logic exceeds targets; gap is in UI edge cases.

3. **Documentation**: AC #8 not completed - testing patterns not added to coding-standards.md.

### Recommendations

- Monitor heap memory usage in CI/CD
- Create follow-up story for AC #8 (testing documentation)
- Consider optional UI edge case coverage improvements
