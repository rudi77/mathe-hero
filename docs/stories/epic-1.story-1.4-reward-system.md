# Story 1.4: Reward System - Unlocking Basic Items

## Status

**Done** ✅

## Story

**As a** User (Child),
**I want** to unlock a new styling item (e.g., a new color, a simple accessory) after successfully solving a certain number of math problems,
**so that** I feel rewarded for my effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A simple counter tracks the number of correctly solved problems.
2. Upon reaching a predefined threshold (e.g., 5 correct answers), a new styling item is designated as "unlocked".
3. The user is notified visually when a new item is unlocked.
4. The unlocked status of items is tracked (initially, can be in memory or simple variable).
5. Unit tests verify the unlocking logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement progress tracking (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create counter for correctly solved problems
  - [x] Update counter on successful answers
  - [x] Store counter in AppContext
- [x] Implement unlock logic (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Create rewardManager.ts with unlock thresholds
  - [x] Define unlock rules for styling items
  - [x] Track unlocked item status
- [x] Implement unlock notification (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create visual notification component
  - [x] Display newly unlocked item
  - [x] Add celebration animation/effect
- [x] Write unit tests (AC: 5)
  - [x] Test unlock logic
  - [x] Test threshold calculations
  - [x] Test edge cases

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture

**Reward Manager (`rewardManager.ts`):**
- Manages unlock thresholds and rules
- Tracks which items are unlocked
- Calculates when new items should be unlocked

**Integration Points:**
- AppContext stores unlocked items state
- MathTask component triggers reward checks
- ItemPalette displays unlocked items

### Testing

- Unit tests for rewardManager.ts unlock logic
- Tests for threshold calculations
- Edge case testing (multiple unlocks, boundary conditions)

- Item unlock status tracking functional
- Unit tests implemented and passing

### File List

**Created:**
- `src/client/src/lib/rewardManager.ts`
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/rewardManager.test.ts`

**Modified:**
- `src/client/src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` (added unlock tracking)

- `src/client/src/components/ItemPalette.tsx` (displays unlocked items)

## QA Results

**Status:** ✅ Passed (per Quinn's traceability report)

**Findings:**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Progress counter tracking correctly solved problems
- Items unlock at predefined thresholds (verified with 5 correct answers)
- Visual notifications clear and exciting for children
- Unlocked status properly tracked
- Unit tests passing with good coverage of unlock scenarios
