## 🚀 Implementation Sequence

### Recommended Order

**Week 1 (Priority 1 - Testing Foundation):**

1. **Story 1.9: Comprehensive Test Suite** (Days 1-5)
   - Expand mathEngine.ts unit tests to >90% coverage
   - Expand rewardManager.ts unit tests to >90% coverage
   - Create db.ts unit tests (>80% coverage)
   - Create test fixtures/factories
   - Add component tests for all 5 major components
   - Achieve >70% overall coverage
   - Document testing patterns

2. **Story 1.10: CI/CD Pipeline** (Days 6-7)
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - Configure coverage reporting
   - Add coverage badge to README
   - Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)
   - Update documentation

**Week 2 (Priority 2 - UX Polish):**

3. **Story 1.11: Child-Friendly UX Polish** (Days 8-12)
   - Design or source custom character SVG
   - Implement custom character in CharacterDisplay
   - Rewrite error messages for children

   - Simple sentences, encouraging tone, no technical jargon

3. **Gemischte Aufgaben:** Fix randomization
   - Currently defaults to 'addition'
   - Should randomly select from all 6 topics

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Coverage Targets

**DO NOT** reduce coverage targets below documented standards:
- >90% for mathEngine.ts
- >90% for rewardManager.ts
- >80% for db.ts
- >70% overall project coverage

These align with our architecture document and are achievable.

### No Scope Reduction

All 3 stories (1.9, 1.10, 1.11) are **REQUIRED** for Epic 1 completion per stakeholder decision. Do not defer Story 1.11 without explicit approval.

### Quality Over Speed

**No hard deadlines exist.** Take the time to:
- Write comprehensive tests
- Set up CI/CD correctly
- Polish UX thoughtfully

Quality establishes the baseline for all future work.

### Testing First

Complete Story 1.9 (testing) before making UX changes in Story 1.11. This ensures changes are validated by automated tests.

**Key Decision:**
- All 3 stories (1.9, 1.10, 1.11) required for Epic 1 completion
- 70% coverage target maintained (not reduced)
- PM (John) creating all story files
- No hard deadlines (quality over speed)
- User testing deferred until after all stories complete
