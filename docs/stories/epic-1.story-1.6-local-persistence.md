# Story 1.6: Local Persistence - Saving Progress

## Status

**Done** ✅

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** the user's unlocked items and current progress (e.g., correct answer streak for rewards) to be saved locally in the browser,
**so that** progress is not lost when the app is closed and reopened.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The list/status of unlocked styling items is saved using IndexedDB.
2. Relevant progress metrics (e.g., counter towards next reward) are saved.
3. When the app restarts, previously unlocked items are available on the styling screen.
4. Progress towards the next reward is correctly loaded.
5. Data is saved reliably and persists across browser sessions.
6. Unit tests verify data saving and loading logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Set up IndexedDB integration (AC: 1, 5)
  - [x] Create db.ts with IndexedDB wrapper
  - [x] Define database schema
  - [x] Implement CRUD operations
- [x] Implement saving unlocked items (AC: 1)
  - [x] Save unlocked items to IndexedDB
  - [x] Update on item unlock events
- [x] Implement saving progress metrics (AC: 2)
  - [x] Save correct answer counter
  - [x] Save current difficulty level
  - [x] Save selected topic
- [x] Implement data loading on app start (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Load unlocked items from IndexedDB
  - [x] Load progress metrics
  - [x] Initialize AppContext with saved data
- [x] Write unit tests (AC: 6)
  - [x] Test save operations
  - [x] Test load operations
  - [x] Test persistence across sessions

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture

**Database Layer (`db.ts`):**
- Wraps IndexedDB API for easier usage
- Provides typed interfaces for data storage
- Handles errors and edge cases

**Data Schema:**
```typescript
{
  unlockedItems: string[],
  correctAnswerCount: number,
  currentDifficulty: number,
  selectedTopic: string,
  appliedItems: Record<string, string>
}
```

**Integration:**
- AppContext loads data on mount
- Data saved after each significant state change
- Automatic persistence without user action

### Testing

- Unit tests for db.ts CRUD operations
- Tests for data serialization/deserialization
- Edge case testing (corrupted data, missing keys)

## Dev Agent Record

### Completion Notes

**Note:** This is retroactive documentation of completed story.

**Implementation Summary:**
- IndexedDB integration successfully implemented
- Unlocked items and progress metrics saved reliably
- Data persistence working across browser sessions
- App correctly loads saved state on restart
- Unit tests implemented and passing

### File List

**Created:**
- `src/client/src/lib/db.ts`
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/db.test.ts`

**Modified:**
- `src/client/src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` (integrated data loading/saving)
- `src/client/src/lib/rewardManager.ts` (save on unlock events)

## QA Results

**Status:** ✅ Passed (per Quinn's traceability report)

**Findings:**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Unlocked items saved and loaded correctly using IndexedDB
- Progress metrics (correct answer count, difficulty level) persisting
- Previously unlocked items available on app restart
- Progress towards next reward correctly restored
- Data persistence reliable across multiple browser sessions
- Unit tests passing with >80% coverage of db.ts
