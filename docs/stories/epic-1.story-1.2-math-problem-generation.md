# Story 1.2: Math Engine - Problem Generation & Basic Display

## Status

**Done** ✅

## Story

**As a** User (Child),
**I want** to be presented with basic math problems (initially focusing on Addition/Subtraction up to 1000) from the 3rd-grade curriculum,
**so that** I can start practicing math.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A mechanism exists to load/generate math problems (e.g., Addition/Subtraction up to 1000).
2. A dedicated screen or modal can display a math problem (question and input area/options).
3. User input for the answer is captured (e.g., via a number pad or multiple choice).
4. Basic (non-adaptive) problem presentation logic is implemented.
5. Unit tests verify problem generation/display logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement math problem generation engine (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create mathEngine.ts with problem generation logic
  - [x] Implement Addition problems (up to 1000)
  - [x] Implement Subtraction problems (up to 1000)
- [x] Create math problem display UI (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create MathTask.tsx component
  - [x] Implement problem display layout
  - [x] Create input area for answers
- [x] Implement answer input capture (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create number input field
  - [x] Handle user input events
  - [x] Submit answer functionality
- [x] Write unit tests (AC: 5)
  - [x] Test problem generation logic
  - [x] Test problem display rendering

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture

**Math Engine (`mathEngine.ts`):**
- Generates math problems based on difficulty level and topic
- Supports Addition, Subtraction operations
- Returns problem object with question, answer, and metadata

**MathTask Component:**
- Displays math problem to user
- Captures user input
- Integrates with AppContext for state management

### Testing

- Unit tests for `mathEngine.ts` problem generation
- Component tests for `MathTask.tsx` rendering and interaction
- Test coverage for edge cases (boundaries, negative numbers)

## Change Log

## Dev Agent Record

### Completion Notes

**Note:** This is retroactive documentation of completed story.

**Implementation Summary:**
- Math engine successfully implemented with problem generation for Addition and Subtraction
- MathTask component created for displaying problems and capturing user input
- Basic (non-adaptive) problem presentation logic working
- Unit tests implemented and passing

### File List

**Created:**
- `src/client/src/lib/mathEngine.ts`
- `src/client/src/components/MathTask.tsx`
- `src/client/src/lib/__tests__/mathEngine.test.ts`

**Modified:**
- `src/client/src/App.tsx` (integrated MathTask component)

## QA Results

**Status:** ✅ Passed (per Quinn's traceability report)

**Findings:**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Problem generation working correctly for Addition/Subtraction up to 1000
- Math problem display UI functional and age-appropriate
- User input capture working as expected
- Unit tests passing with good coverage
