# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the **Mathe-Stylistin** Web Application MVP. [cite_start]It covers the application structure, component design, data management, and technical standards necessary to build the initial version based on the requirements defined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) [cite: 1603] [cite_start]and the UI/UX Specification[cite: 1555]. [cite_start]Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies[cite: 408]. As this MVP is a React-based web application, this document covers both client-side application logic and UI-related architectural concerns.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

[cite_start]Based on the PRD and Project Brief, this is a **greenfield project**[cite: 1637]. [cite_start]The project uses **React with TypeScript and Vite** as the foundation[cite: 1021, 1155]. [cite_start]The application follows modern React conventions with a client-server monorepo structure, using Vite for fast development and optimized production builds[cite: 416].
