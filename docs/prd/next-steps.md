# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review the attached PRD (`docs/prd.md`) and the originating Project Brief (`docs/brief.md`) for the 'Mathe-Stylistin' app. [cite_start]Your task is to create the **UI/UX Specification** using the `front-end-spec-tmpl.yaml`[cite: 1046]. [cite_start]Focus on translating the PRD's UI goals, user needs (3rd grader), and functional requirements into a clear specification covering information architecture, user flows, wireframe concepts (if needed), component ideas, branding/style direction, accessibility, and responsiveness for the Android MVP[cite: 1046].

### Architect Prompt

Please review the attached PRD (`docs/prd.md`) and the originating Project Brief (`docs/brief.md`) for the 'Mathe-Stylistin' app. [cite_start]Your task is to create the **Architecture Document** using the `architecture-tmpl.yaml` (note: since this is primarily a client-side MVP, a frontend or fullstack template might be adaptable, but focus on the Android native aspects)[cite: 1047]. [cite_start]Detail the technical architecture based on the PRD's requirements and technical assumptions (Native Android/Kotlin/Compose, local storage via Room/DataStore, adaptive difficulty logic, math engine structure, testing strategy)[cite: 1047]. [cite_start]Ensure the architecture supports the defined MVP scope and considers potential future scalability (like backend integration or iOS support)[cite: 1047].
