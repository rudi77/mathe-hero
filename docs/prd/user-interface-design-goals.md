# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be highly engaging, visually rewarding, and simple to navigate for an 8-9 year old. The primary loop (solve math -> get reward -> style) must be clear and satisfying. The focus should be on encouraging creativity and exploration while seamlessly integrating the math practice. The interface should feel playful and positive, reducing potential math anxiety.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Direct Manipulation:** Applying colors/accessories should be intuitive, likely via drag-and-drop or simple taps.
* **Clear Feedback:** Correct/incorrect math answers need immediate, encouraging, and clear visual/audio feedback. Unlocking items should feel like a celebratory event.
* **Minimal Text:** Instructions and feedback should rely heavily on visuals and icons, with minimal text, appropriate for the age group.
* **Progressive Disclosure:** Keep the interface clean. Perhaps math problems appear in a dedicated modal or section, separate from the main styling canvas. Advanced styling options could be revealed gradually.

### Core Screens and Views

*(Conceptual - names and specifics TBD)*

* [cite_start]**Main Styling Screen:** Shows the character head, available styling items/colors, and access to math tasks[cite: 1015].
* [cite_start]**Math Task Screen/Modal:** Presents the math problems clearly, with input methods suitable for the age group (e.g., number pad, multiple choice)[cite: 1015].
* [cite_start]**Rewards/Unlocks Screen:** Shows newly unlocked items after successful task completion[cite: 1015].
* [cite_start]**Topic Selection Screen:** Allows the user to choose which math area to practice[cite: 1015].
* [cite_start]**(Maybe) Basic Item Inventory:** A simple way to view already unlocked items[cite: 1015].

### Accessibility

* **Target:** Aim for basic accessibility principles initially (e.g., sufficient contrast, clear focus indicators, reasonably sized touch targets). [cite_start]WCAG AA could be a post-MVP target[cite: 1016].

### Branding

* **Style:** Playful, colorful, encouraging, and age-appropriate. Should appeal to children interested in creativity and styling. (No specific corporate branding mentioned, assuming creative freedom) [cite_start][cite: 1017].

### Target Device and Platforms

* **Target:** Web browsers on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for future consideration. [cite_start][cite: 1019].
