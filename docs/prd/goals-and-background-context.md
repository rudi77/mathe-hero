# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* [cite_start]**Improve Math Skills:** Increase user proficiency and confidence in 3rd-grade math topics (Bavarian curriculum)[cite: 1007].
* [cite_start]**Engage Target User:** Make math practice enjoyable and achieve regular app usage through the creative styling game mechanic[cite: 1007].
* [cite_start]**Validate Core Concept:** Confirm the gamified approach (math tasks unlock creative rewards) effectively motivates learning[cite: 1007].
* [cite_start]**Launch MVP:** Successfully release a stable, functional MVP as a web application[cite: 1007].
* [cite_start]**User Success:** Ensure users show improved performance (accuracy), increased engagement (session frequency/duration), feel a sense of progress (items unlocked), and master specific topics[cite: 1007].

### Background Context

[cite_start]Many primary school children, particularly those in 3rd grade in Bavaria, find mathematics unengaging or difficult, leading to poor motivation and performance[cite: 1008]. [cite_start]Traditional learning methods often don't resonate with creatively inclined children who learn best through play[cite: 1008]. [cite_start]Existing solutions may lack alignment with specific regional curricula or fail to leverage non-mathematical interests as effective motivators[cite: 1008].

[cite_start]"Mathe-Stylistin" aims to address this by integrating math practice (aligned with the 3rd-grade Bavarian curriculum) directly into a creative styling game[cite: 1008]. [cite_start]By solving math problems, users unlock digital items (colors, accessories) to style a virtual character head[cite: 1008]. [cite_start]This core loop, combined with adaptive difficulty and topic selection, intends to transform math practice into an intrinsically rewarding activity, boosting both skills and confidence[cite: 1008].
