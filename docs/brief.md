# Project Brief: Mathe-Stylistin

## Executive Summary

"Mathe-Stylistin" is a concept for an Android (and later iOS) mobile application designed to help primary school children, initially focusing on 3rd graders in Bavaria, improve their math skills in a fun and engaging way. The core idea is to motivate learning by rewarding correctly solved math problems with creative tools (digital makeup, accessories) to style a virtual character head, directly addressing the user's interest in creative activities. The app aims to cover the relevant curriculum while adapting to the child's learning pace.

## Problem Statement

Many primary school children, like the user's daughter in 3rd grade (Bavaria), struggle with math or find it boring, leading to poor grades and a lack of motivation. Traditional learning methods often fail to engage children who are more creatively inclined or learn best through play. Existing solutions might not align well with specific regional curricula or cater sufficiently to non-mathematical interests (like styling, creativity, and collecting) as primary motivators. There's a need for a learning tool that transforms math practice from a chore into an intrinsically rewarding creative activity.

## Proposed Solution

"Mathe-Stylistin" tackles this problem by integrating math exercises directly into a creative styling game. The core loop involves solving math problems aligned with the 3rd-grade Bavarian curriculum to earn or unlock digital items like colors, makeup tools, accessories (hats, glasses, jewelry), and special effects (glitter). These items are then used to style a virtual character head. The app will feature adaptive difficulty, adjusting the complexity of math problems based on the child's performance, and allow users to select specific math topics to practice. This gamified approach leverages the child's interest in styling and creativity to encourage regular math practice and build confidence.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: 3rd Grade Math Explorer (Creative Focus)

* **Profile:** Primary school children, specifically starting with 3rd graders in Bavaria (approximately 8-9 years old). This segment includes children who find traditional math learning unengaging or difficult and are motivated by creative expression, collecting, and game-like rewards. They enjoy activities like drawing, crafting, styling, and storytelling.
* **Current Behaviors:** They may avoid math homework, show low confidence in their math abilities, and prefer spending time on creative or imaginative play (digital or physical). They respond well to visual stimuli and enjoy seeing immediate results from their actions.
* **Needs & Pain Points:** They need a way to practice math that doesn't feel like a chore. They struggle with abstract concepts and benefit from visual or contextualized learning. Their pain points include math anxiety, boredom with repetitive exercises, and frustration when they don't understand concepts.
* **Goals:** They want to feel successful and competent. While they might not explicitly state wanting to get better at math, they want to avoid negative feelings associated with it and enjoy their learning activities. In the context of the app, their goal is to unlock cool items and create visually appealing styles.

### Secondary User Segment: (Optional)

* **Parents:** May want to track progress or understand the learning methodology.
* **Teachers:** Could potentially use it as a supplemental tool. (Focus remains on the primary user for MVP).

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

* **Target Platforms:** Android (MVP), with plans to support iOS post-MVP.
* **Browser/OS Support:** Target recent Android versions (e.g., Android 10 and above) covering the majority of devices used by the target age group. Specific minimum version TBD.
* **Performance Requirements:** The app should run smoothly on mid-range Android devices. Interactions (solving problems, applying styles) should feel responsive without noticeable lag. Initial load time should be reasonable (e.g., under 5 seconds).

### Technology Preferences

*(Initial thoughts - subject to Architect's review)*

* **Frontend/App Framework:** Native Android development (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) is the current assumption for optimal performance and platform integration for the MVP. Cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter) remain an option if faster iOS expansion becomes a higher priority post-MVP.
* **Backend:** Local device storage (Android Preferences/DataStore or Room) will be used for MVP to store unlocked items and difficulty level. No backend needed initially.
* **Database:** (If local storage) Android Room or DataStore.
* **Hosting/Infrastructure:** N/A for MVP.

### Architecture Considerations

*(High-level thoughts - Architect will detail)*

* **Repository Structure:** Single repository (Polyrepo) for the Android app.
* **Service Architecture:** N/A for MVP (client-side logic primarily).
* **Integration Requirements:** None for MVP.
* **Security/Compliance:** Focus on child data privacy (COPPA/GDPR-K). Minimize data collection due to local storage focus.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

* **Budget:** Assumed limited budget, influencing technology choices and scope.
* **Timeline:** Assumed flexible, but MVP approach prioritizes speed to validation.
* **Resources:** Assumed primarily single developer initially. Need for external assets (graphics) might be a constraint.
* **Technical:** Must run on standard Android devices. Curriculum must align with 3rd Grade, Bavaria. Child data privacy regulations must be adhered to.

### Key Assumptions

* The core game loop (math practice unlocks creative rewards) will be sufficiently motivating for the target user.
* The math problems aligned with the Bavarian 3rd-grade curriculum are appropriate and effective.
* The target user has access to a suitable Android device.
* Local storage is sufficient for MVP data persistence.
* Native Android development (Kotlin) provides the best balance for the MVP (current assumption).
* The visual styling aspect is a strong enough intrinsic reward.
