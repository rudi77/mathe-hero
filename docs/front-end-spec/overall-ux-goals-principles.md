# Overall UX Goals & Principles

## Target User Personas

* **Primary: 3rd Grade Math Explorer (Creative Focus)**: Child (8-9 yrs, Bavaria) who dislikes traditional math but enjoys creative/styling activities. [cite_start]Needs engagement, visual rewards, and reduced math anxiety[cite: 1374].
* **(Secondary - Low Priority for MVP):** Parents, Teachers.

## Usability Goals

* **Ease of Learning:** New users should understand the core loop (solve -> unlock -> style) within the first session (e.g., < 5 minutes).
* **Engagement:** The styling aspect should be compelling enough to encourage regular math practice sessions (e.g., 3+ times/week).
* **Error Prevention/Recovery:** Math input should be clear; feedback for wrong answers should be gentle and non-discouraging. Styling actions should be easily undoable if possible.
* [cite_start]**Satisfaction:** Users should feel a sense of accomplishment both from solving math problems and from creating styles[cite: 1375].

## Design Principles

1.  **Playful Encouragement:** The tone, visuals, and feedback should be positive and encouraging, never punitive.
2.  **Clarity & Simplicity:** Interactions and instructions must be immediately understandable for the target age group, minimizing text.
3.  **Rewarding Creativity:** Unlocking and using styling items should feel genuinely rewarding and be the primary motivator.
4.  **Seamless Learning:** Math tasks should feel integrated into the game flow, not like a separate, jarring interruption.
5.  [cite_start]**Safety First:** Design adheres to child safety and privacy principles (especially important given GDPR-K)[cite: 1377].
