notes: |
  This is a textbook example of how to execute a brownfield enhancement:
  - Minimal, focused change
  - Pattern consistency
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Clear documentation
  - Zero technical debt

  The implementation quality is exceptional and demonstrates strong
  engineering practices. This story can serve as a reference template
  for future similar work.
