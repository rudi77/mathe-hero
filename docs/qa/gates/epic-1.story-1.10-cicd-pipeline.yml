summary: |
  Excellent CI/CD infrastructure implementation that goes beyond basic requirements.
  Developer demonstrates strong understanding of modern DevOps practices with:
  - Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow with type-checking, tests, and coverage
  - Dual coverage reporting (Codecov + GitHub Actions summary)
  - Well-configured pre-commit hooks with documented escape hatches
  - Thorough documentation in German language context
  - Proper monorepo structure handling
  - Latest action versions and appropriate tool versions

  Three minor concerns identified are non-blocking improvements suitable for
  future iterations. All 7 acceptance criteria fully validated with clear
  traceability. Production-ready for immediate deployment.

next_steps:
  - "Merge PR to enable CI/CD for team"
  - "Configure CODECOV_TOKEN in GitHub repository secrets"
  - "Test workflow end-to-end on first PR"
  - "Consider creating follow-up story for performance optimizations"
