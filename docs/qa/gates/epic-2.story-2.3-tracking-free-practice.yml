additional_notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation of a tracking-free practice mode. The developer has
  successfully isolated the component from all persistence mechanisms while maintaining
  code quality and comprehensive test coverage. The critical "no database writes" requirement
  is architecturally sound based on code review, though manual QA should confirm behavior
  in a live browser environment.

  The minor issues identified are truly minor and represent best practices improvements
  rather than functional defects. They can be addressed in a future refactoring story
  without blocking this story's completion.

  Recommendation: Proceed to manual QA execution (AC 13), and if that passes, mark story as Done.
